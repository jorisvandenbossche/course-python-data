## What have we done so far?

+++

What we have encountered until now:

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [pandas .plot](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotnine as p9
import seaborn as sns
```

### When should I use Seaborn versus Matplotlib?

+++

There is `titanic` data again...

```{code-cell} ipython3
titanic = pd.read_csv("data/titanic.csv")
```

Pandas/Matplotlib plot...

```{code-cell} ipython3
with plt.style.context('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid'):  # context manager for styling the figure
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    
    survival_rate = titanic.groupby("Pclass")['Survived'].mean()
    survival_rate.plot(kind='bar', color='grey', 
                       rot=0, figsize=(6, 4), ax=ax)
    
    ylab = ax.set_ylabel("Survival rate")
    xlab = ax.set_xlabel("Cabin class")
```

Using Seaborn:

```{code-cell} ipython3
with sns.axes_style("whitegrid"):    # context manager for styling the figure
    
    g = sns.catplot(data=titanic, 
                    x="Pclass", y="Survived", 
                    kind="bar", estimator=np.mean,
                    errorbar=None, color="grey")
    
    g.set_axis_labels("Cabin class", "Survival rate")
```

An important difference is the *imperative* approach from `matplotlib` versus the *declarative* approach from `seaborn`:

+++

| imperative | declarative |
|------------|-------------|
| Specify **how** something should be done |  Specify **what** should be done            |
| **Manually specify** the individual plotting steps | Individual plotting steps based on **declaration** |
| e.g. `for ax in axes: ax.plot(...` | e.g. `, col=my_variable` |

+++

Which approach to use, is sometimes just a matter of personal preference... Although, take following elements into account:

+++

* When your data consists of only **1 categorical variable**, such as

  | ID | variable 1 | variable 2 | variabel ... | 
  |------------|-------------| ---- | ----- |
  | 1 | 0.2 | 0.8 | ... |
  | 2 | 0.3 | 0.1 | ... |
  | 3 | 0.9 | 0.6 | ... |
  | 4 | 0.1 | 0.7 | ... |
  | ...  | ... | ... | ...|

  the added value of using Seaborn approach is LOW. Pandas `.plot()` will probably suffice.

* When working with **timeseries data** from sensors or continuous logging, such as

  | datetime | station 1 | station 2 | station ... | 
  |------------|-------------| ---- | ----- |
  | 2017-12-20T17:50:46Z | 0.2 | 0.8 | ... |
  | 2017-12-20T17:50:52Z | 0.3 | 0.1 | ... |
  | 2017-12-20T17:51:03Z | 0.9 | 0.6 | ... |
  | 2017-12-20T17:51:40Z | 0.1 | 0.7 | ... |
  | ...  | ... | ... | ...|

  the added value of using a grammar of graphics approach is LOW. Pandas `.plot()` will probably suffice.

* When working with different experiments, different conditions, (factorial) **experimental designs**, such as

  | ID | origin | addition (ml)  | measured_value | 
  |----|-----------| ----- | ------ |
  | 1  | Eindhoven | 0.3 | 7.2 |
  | 2  | Eindhoven | 0.6 | 6.7 |
  | 3  | Eindhoven | 0.9 | 5.2 |
  | 4  | Destelbergen | 0.3 | 7.2 |
  | 5  | Destelbergen | 0.6 | 6.8 |
  | ...  | ... | ... | ...|

  the added value of using Seaborn approach is HIGH. Represent your data [`tidy`](http://www.jeannicholashould.com/tidy-data-in-python.html) to achieve maximal benefit!

* When you want to visualize __distributions__ of data or __regressions__ between variables, the added value of using Seaborn approach is HIGH.

+++

## The 'Grammar of graphics'

+++

Seaborn provides a high level abstraction to create charts and is highly related to the concept of the so-called (layered) `Grammar of Graphics`, a visualization framework originally described [by Leland Wilkinson](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447), which became famous due to the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) R package. 

The `Grammar of Graphics` is especially targeted for so-called __tidy__ `DataFrame` representations and has currently implementations in different programming languages, e.g.

- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for R
- [vega-lite API](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite-api/) for Javascript

Each chart requires the definition of:

1. data
1. a geometry (e.g. points, lines, bars,...) 
1. a translation of the variables in the data to the elements of the geometry (aka `aesthetics` or `encoding`)

And additional elements can be added or adjusted to create more complex charts.

In the Python visualization ecosystem, both `Plotnine` as well as `Altair` provide an implementation of the `Grammar of Graphics`

| Plotnine | Altair |
|------------|-------------|
| Works well with Pandas | Works well with Pandas |
| Built on top of [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) |  Built on top of [Vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)         |
| Python-clone of the R package `ggplot` | Plot specification to define a vega-lite 'JSON string' |
| Static plots | Web/interactive plots |

+++

### Plotnine

+++

> _[Plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python, it is based on `ggplot2`. The grammar allows users to compose plots by explicitly mapping data to the visual objects that make up the plot._

The syntax of the package will feel _very familiar_ to users familiar with the R package ggplot, but might feel _odd_ for Python developers. 

The main ingredients (data, geometry, aesthetics) of the `Grammar of Graphics` framework need to be defined to create a chart:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import plotnine as p9

myplot = (p9.ggplot(titanic)                      # 1. DATA         
    + p9.geom_bar(                                # 2. GEOMETRY, geom_*
        stat='stat_summary',
        mapping=p9.aes(x='Pclass', y='Survived')  # 3. AESTHETICS - relate variables to geometry
    )    
)
myplot
```

And further customization (_layers_) can be added to the specification, e.g.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import plotnine as p9

myplot = (p9.ggplot(titanic)                      # 1. DATA         
    + p9.geom_bar(                                # 2. GEOMETRY, geom_*
        stat='stat_summary',
        mapping=p9.aes(x='Pclass', y='Survived')  # 3. AESTHETICS - relate variables to geometry
    )
    + p9.xlab("Cabin class")          # labels
    + p9.theme_minimal()              # theme
    # ...
)

myplot
```

As Plotnine is built on top of Matplotlib, one can still retrieve the Matplotlib `Figure` object from Plotnine for eventual customization.

The trick is to use the `.draw()` function in Plotnine:

```{code-cell} ipython3
my_plt_version = myplot.draw();  # extract as Matplotlib Figure

# Do some Matplotlib magick...
my_plt_version.axes[0].set_title("Titanic fare price per cabin class")
ax2 = my_plt_version.add_axes([0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.3], label="ax2")
my_plt_version
```

<div class="alert alert-info">

**REMEMBER**

- If you are already familiar to ggplot in R, the conversion of Plotnine will be easy.
- Plotnine is based on Matplotlib, making further customization possible as we have seen before.

</div>

+++

### Altair

> *[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on Vega-Lite.*

```{code-cell} ipython3
import altair as alt
```

Altair implements the `Grammar of Graphics` with the same main ingredients, but a different syntax:

```{code-cell} ipython3
(alt.Chart(titanic)                       # 1. DATA         
    .mark_bar()                           # 2. GEOMETRY, geom_*
    .encode(                              # 3. AESTHETICS - relate variables to geometry
        x=alt.X('Pclass:O', 
                axis=alt.Axis(title='Cabin class')),
        y=alt.Y('mean(Survived):Q', 
                axis=alt.Axis(format='%', 
                              title='Survival rate'))
    )
)
```

When encoding the variables for the chosen geometry, Altair provides a specific syntax on the data type of each variable. For information on this `...:Q`, `...:N`,`...:O`, see the [data type section](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/encoding.html#encoding-data-types) of the documentation:

Data Type |	Shorthand Code |	Description
----------|-----------------|---------------
quantitative |		Q |		a continuous real-valued quantity
ordinal |		O |		a discrete ordered quantity
nominal |		N |		a discrete unordered category
temporal |		T |		a time or date value

+++

Altair is made for the web, providing interactive features for the plots. See more examples [here](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html#interactive-charts).

```{code-cell} ipython3
brush = alt.selection_interval()

(alt.Chart(titanic)
     .mark_circle().encode( 
        x="Fare:Q",   
        y="Age:Q",
        column="Sex:O",
        color=alt.condition(brush, "Pclass:N", alt.value('grey')),
).add_params(brush))
```

<div class="alert alert-info">

**Remember**

- Altair provides a pure-Python <b>Grammar of Graphics</b> implementation
- Altair is built on top of the <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a> visualization grammar, which can be interpreted as a language to specify a graph (from data to figure).
- Altair easily integrates with web-technology (HTML/Javascript).

</div>

+++

## Interactivity and the web

+++

Whereas Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotnine are packages to create static charts, the charts created by Altair are mainly targeted to __integrate in websites and web applications__. 

With the increasing interest for interactive data visualization and dashboards, other packages were designed to fulfill this requirement. Both the [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) package and the [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) package can be used as a stand-alone data visualization tool or as part of web applications and dashboards.

+++

__Note:__ Bokeh and Plotly are also the components for some packages to build interactive web applications, respectively [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) and [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/).

+++

### Bokeh

+++

> *[Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation*.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from bokeh.plotting import figure, output_file, show
```

By default, Bokeh will open a new webpage to plot the figure. Still, an **integration with Jupyter notebooks** is provided:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from bokeh.io import output_notebook
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
output_notebook()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
p = figure()
p.line(x=[1, 2, 3], 
       y=[4,6,2])
show(p)
```

<div class="alert alert-danger">

__Warning__ 

- Bokeh does <b>not</b> support <code>eps</code>, <code>pdf</code> export of plots directly. Exporting to svg is available but still limited, see <a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/export.html">documentation</a>.

</div>

+++

To accomodate the users of **Pandas**, a `pd.DataFrame` can also be used as the input for a Bokeh plot:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource

flow_data = pd.read_csv("data/vmm_flowdata.csv", parse_dates=True, index_col=0)

source_data = ColumnDataSource(data=flow_data)
```

Useful to know when you want to use the index as well:
> *If the DataFrame has a named index column, then CDS will also have a column with this name. However, if the index name (or any subname of a MultiIndex) is None, then the CDS will have a column generically named index for the index.*

```{code-cell} ipython3
p = figure(x_axis_type="datetime", height=200, width=600)
p.line(x='Time', y='LS06_347', source=source_data)
show(p)
```

Bokeh has lots of functionalities to adjust and customize charts, e.g. by adding new annotations to the figure object:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, BoxAnnotation, Label
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
p = figure(x_axis_type="datetime", height=200, width=600)
p.line(x='Time', y='L06_347', source=source_data)
p.circle(x='Time', y='L06_347', source=source_data, 
         fill_alpha= 0.3, line_alpha=0.3)

alarm_box = BoxAnnotation(bottom=10, fill_alpha=0.3, 
                          fill_color='#ff6666')  # arbitrary value; this is NOT the real-case value
p.add_layout(alarm_box)

alarm_label = Label(text="Flood risk", x_units='screen', 
                    x= 10, y=10, text_color="#330000")
p.add_layout(alarm_label)

show(p)
```

### hvplot/holoviews

+++

> hvPlot provides an alternative for the static plotting API provided by Pandas and other libraries, with an interactive Bokeh-based plotting API that supports panning, zooming, hovering, and clickable/selectable legends

+++

Similar to Matplotlib, Bokeh is a low-level package. Whereas Matplotlib provides the building blocks to define static plots, Bokeh provides the building blocks to create interactive visualizations. 

Just as Seaborn provides an abstraction on top of the Matplotlib package, the [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/index.html) and [Holoviews](http://holoviews.org/index.html) packages provide an abstraction on top of Bokeh, i.e. plots with less code.

_Actually, hvplot is built on top of Holoviews, which is built on top of Bokeh_

```{code-cell} ipython3
import hvplot.pandas

flow_data.hvplot()
```

The link in between hvplot/holoviews and Bokeh (for further adjustments) can be made using the `render` function:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import holoviews as hv

fig = hv.render(flow_data.hvplot())
type(fig)
```

<div class="alert alert-info">

A similar advice as with Matplotlib: "do as much as you easily can in your convenience layer of choice [e.g. hvplot, GeoViews, Holoviews], use Bokeh for customization.
    
**More Bokeh?**

- <a href="https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html">Documentation</a> is very extensive...
    
</div>

+++

### Plotly

+++

> _[plotly.py](https://plot.ly/python/) is an interactive, browser-based graphing library for Python_

```{code-cell} ipython3
import plotly
```

Similar to Bokeh, Plotly provides a lot of building blocks for interactive plotting, see https://plot.ly/python/#fundamentals. It consists of two main components: __plotly__ provides all the basic components (so called `plotly.graph_objects`) to create plots and __plotly express__ provides a high-level wrapper/abstraction around `plotly.graph_objects` for rapid data exploration and figure generation. The latter focuses more on _tidy_ data representation.

As an example: create a our example plot using the plotly `graph_objects`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import plotly.graph_objects as go

survival_rate = titanic.groupby("Pclass")['Survived'].mean().reset_index()

fig = go.Figure()

fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
    x=survival_rate["Pclass"],
    y=survival_rate["Survived"])
)
fig.update_xaxes(type='category')
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Cabin class",
    yaxis_title="Survival rate")
fig.show()
```

Similar to other high-level interfaces, this can be done by `Plotly Express` as well, supporting direct interaction with a Pandas `DataFrame`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import plotly.express as px

# plotly express does not provide the count statistics out of the box, so calculating these
survival_rate = titanic.groupby("Pclass")['Survived'].mean().reset_index() 

px.bar(survival_rate, x="Pclass", y="Survived")
```

<div class="alert alert-danger">

**Notice!** 

Prior versions of plotly.py contained functionality for creating figures in both "online" and "offline" modes. Since version 4 plotly is "offline"-only. Make sure you check the latest documentation and watch out with outdated Stackoverflow suggestions. The previous commercial/online version is rebranded into <a href='https://plot.ly/online-chart-maker/'>chart studio</a>.

</div>

+++

The main interface to use plotly with Pandas is using Plotly Express:

```{code-cell} ipython3
df = flow_data.reset_index()

fig = px.line(flow_data.reset_index(), x="Time", y=df.columns,
              hover_data={"Time": "|%B %d, %Y"}
             )
fig.show()
```

<div class="alert alert-info">

A similar advice as with Matplotlib/Bokeh: "do as much as you easily can in your convenience layer of choice [e.g. plotly express].
    
**More plotly?**   

- Check the <a href="https://plot.ly/python/">package gallery</a> for plot examples.
- Plotly express provides high level plotting functionalities and plotly graph objects the low level components.

</div>

+++

<div class="alert alert-warning">

 <b>For R users...</b>: 
<br><br>
Both plotly and Bokeh provide interactivity (sliders,..), but are not the full equivalent of [`Rshiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).<br>A similar functionality of Rshiny is provided by [`dash`](https://plot.ly/products/dash/), created by the same company as plotly.
<br>

## Change the default Pandas plotting backend

+++

> _All slightly different syntax to create plots?!_

+++

Different people have different preferences in terms of style/syntax/... So having alternatives is nice. However, Pandas also provides the option to work with different plotting packages without changing the syntax...

During the course, we used the `.plot()` method of Pandas to create charts, which relied on Matplotlib. Matplotlib is the default back-end for Pandas to create plots:

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.options.plotting.backend = 'matplotlib'
flow_data.plot()
```

However, Holoviews/hvplot, Bokeh and Plotly can be used as Pandas back-end for plotting, by defining the `pd.options.plotting.backend` variable:

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.options.plotting.backend = 'holoviews'
flow_data.plot()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.options.plotting.backend = 'plotly'
flow_data.plot()
```

<div class="alert alert-info">

**Remember**

To get an interactive version of a plot created with Pandas, switch the `pd.options.plotting.backend` to `'holoviews'` or `'plotly'` and keep using the `.plot` function as before.

</div>

+++

<div class="alert alert-warning">

**Warning**

When saving Jupyter notebooks with interactive visualizations in the output of multiple cells, the file size will increase a lot, making these files less suitable for version control. 
    
Consider saving your notebook with the outputs cleared (Menu > `Kernel` > `Restart kernel and clear all outputs...`) or automate this with a tool like [nbstripout](https://pypi.org/project/nbstripout/).

</div>

+++

## Your data sets are HUGE?

+++

When you are working with a lot of records, the visualization of the individual points does not always make sense as there are simply to many dots overlapping each other (check [this](https://datashader.org/user_guide/Plotting_Pitfalls.html) notebook for a more detailed explanation).

+++

Consider the open data set:
> Bird tracking - GPS tracking of Lesser Black-backed Gulls and Herring Gulls breeding at the southern North Sea coast https://www.gbif.org/dataset/83e20573-f7dd-4852-9159-21566e1e691e with > 8e6 records

+++

Working with such a data set on a local machine is not straightforward anymore, as this data set will consume a lot of memory to be handled by the default plotting libraries. Moreover, visualizing every single dot is not useful anymore at coarser zoom levels.

+++

The package [datashader](https://datashader.org/) provides a solution for this size of data sets and works together with other packages such as `Bokeh` and `Holoviews`.

+++

The data from [the gull data set](https://zenodo.org/record/3541812#.XfZYcNko-V6) is downloaded and stored it in the `data` folder and is not part of the Github repository. For example, after downloading the [2018 data set](https://zenodo.org/record/3541812/files/HG_OOSTENDE-gps-2018.csv?download=1) from Zenodo:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import holoviews as hv
import hvplot.pandas 
from colorcet import fire

hv.extension('bokeh')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df = pd.read_csv('data/HG_OOSTENDE-gps-2018.csv', nrows=1_000_000, # for the live demo on my laptop, I just use 1_000_000 points
                 usecols=['location-long', 'location-lat', 
                          'individual-local-identifier'])
df.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.hvplot.points('location-long', 'location-lat', geo=True, tiles='ESRI', 
                 datashade=True, aggregator='count', cmap=fire, project=True,
                 xlim=(-5, 5), ylim=(48, 53), frame_width=600)
```
