# Some 'theory': the groupby operation (split-apply-combine)

```{code-cell} ipython3
df = pd.DataFrame({'key':['A','B','C','A','B','C','A','B','C'],
                   'data': [0, 5, 10, 5, 10, 15, 10, 15, 20]})
df
```

### Recap: aggregating functions

+++

When analyzing data, you often calculate summary statistics (aggregations like the mean, max, ...). As we have seen before, we can easily calculate such a statistic for a Series or column using one of the many available methods. For example:

```{code-cell} ipython3
df['data'].sum()
```

However, in many cases your data has certain groups in it, and in that case, you may want to calculate this statistic for each of the groups.

For example, in the above dataframe `df`, there is a column 'key' which has three possible values: 'A', 'B' and 'C'. When we want to calculate the sum for each of those groups, we could do the following:

```{code-cell} ipython3
for key in ['A', 'B', 'C']:
    print(key, df[df['key'] == key]['data'].sum())
```

This becomes very verbose when having multiple groups. You could make the above a bit easier by looping over the different values, but still, it is not very convenient to work with.

What we did above, applying a function on different groups, is a "groupby operation", and pandas provides some convenient functionality for this.

+++

### Groupby: applying functions per group

+++

The "group by" concept: we want to **apply the same function on subsets of your dataframe, based on some key to split the dataframe in subsets**

This operation is also referred to as the "split-apply-combine" operation, involving the following steps:

* **Splitting** the data into groups based on some criteria
* **Applying** a function to each group independently
* **Combining** the results into a data structure

Similar to SQL `GROUP BY`

+++

Instead of doing the manual filtering as above


    df[df['key'] == "A"].sum()
    df[df['key'] == "B"].sum()
    ...

pandas provides the `groupby` method to do exactly this:

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.groupby('key').sum()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.groupby('key').aggregate("sum")
```

And many more methods are available.

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.groupby('key')['data'].sum()
```

# Application of the groupby concept on the titanic data

+++

We go back to the titanic passengers survival data:

```{code-cell} ipython3
df = pd.read_csv("data/titanic.csv")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.head()
```

Make a bar plot to visualize the average Fare payed by people depending on their age. The age column is divided in separate classes using the `pd.cut()` function as provided below.

```{code-cell} ipython3
df['AgeClass'] = pd.cut(df['Age'], bins=np.arange(0,90,10))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

df.groupby('AgeClass', observed=False)['Fare'].mean().plot.bar(rot=0)
```

If you are ready, more groupby exercises can be found below.

# Some more theory

+++

## Specifying the grouper

+++

In the previous example and exercises, we always grouped by a single column by passing its name. But, a column name is not the only value you can pass as the grouper in `df.groupby(grouper)`. Other possibilities for `grouper` are:

- a list of strings (to group by multiple columns)
- a Series (similar to a string indicating a column in df) or array
- function (to be applied on the index)
- levels=[], names of levels in a MultiIndex

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.groupby(df['Age'] < 18)['Survived'].mean()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.groupby(['Pclass', 'Sex'])['Survived'].mean()
```

## The size of groups - value counts

+++

Often you want to know how many elements there are in a certain group (or in other words: the number of occurences of the different values from a column).

To get the size of the groups, we can use `size`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.groupby('Pclass').size()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.groupby('Embarked').size()
```

Another way to obtain such counts, is to use the Series `value_counts` method (which additionally sorts from most to least occurring group):

```{code-cell} ipython3
df['Embarked'].value_counts()
```

# [OPTIONAL] Additional exercises using the movie data

+++

These exercises are based on the [PyCon tutorial of Brandon Rhodes](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial/) (so credit to him!) and the datasets he prepared for that. You can download these data from here: [titles.csv](https://course-python-data.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/titles.csv) and [cast.csv](https://course-python-data.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cast.csv) and put them in the `/notebooks/data` folder.

+++

`cast` dataset: different roles played by actors/actresses in films

- title: title of the movie
- year: year it was released
- name: name of the actor/actress
- type: actor/actress
- n: the order of the role (n=1: leading role)

```{code-cell} ipython3
cast = pd.read_csv('data/cast.csv')
cast.head()
```

`titles` dataset:

* title: title of the movie
* year: year of release

```{code-cell} ipython3
titles = pd.read_csv('data/titles.csv')
titles.head()
```
